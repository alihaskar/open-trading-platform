# order-router

The implements the [executionvenue API](https://github.com/ettec/open-trading-platform/blob/master/proto/services/executionvenue.proto) and is responsible for routing order related requests to the respective execution venue.  The target execution venue of the requests are identified using the market instrument code (Mic) which can correspond directly to a market (e.g. Nasdaq = XNAS, Investors Exchange = IEXG) in the case of straight DMA orders, or alternatively it can be an internally designated mic code used to identify a trading strategy ([smart-router](https://github.com/ettec/open-trading-platform/tree/master/go/execution-venues/smart-router/README.md) = XOSR, [vwap-strategy](https://github.com/ettec/open-trading-platform/tree/master/go/execution-venues/vwap-strategy/README.md)).  Additionally, where this is more than one execution venue service available for a given market the order router will load balance across the venues using the order's listing id (this is the default load balancing algorithm).  The service can be easily scaled by increasing the deployments replica count to whatever is suitable.
